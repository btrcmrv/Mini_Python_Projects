## 1) Quiz Game ##
**Description:**
- Start by welcoming the user and asking if they want to play a quiz game.
- Present the user with four multiple-choice questions about statistical abbreviations.
- Calculate and display the number of correct answers and the percentage of correct answers at the end.

## 2) Random Number Guessing Game ##
**Description:**
- Prompt the user to guess a number between 0 and 10.
- Check if their guess is within the valid range (0-10). If not, tell them to give a valid range.
- Provide feedback on whether their guess is too high or too low.
- Keep track of the number of attempts made by the user.
- Inform the user when they correctly guess the random number.

## 3) Rock, Paper, Scissors Game ##
**Description:**
- Ask the user to choose between rock, paper, scissors, or to quit the game.
- Simulate a game against the computer's choice.
- Keep track of the score for both the computer and the user.
- End the game by typing "q"
- Display the final score at the end of the game.

## 4) Adventure Game ##
**Description:**
- Start by asking the user for their name and welcoming them to the game.
- Present the user with a choice to turn right or left.
- If the user chooses to go left, they encounter a river and must decide whether to swim across it or walk around it.
  - If they swim across it, they are eaten by alligators.
  - If they walk around it, they run out of water and die.
- If the user chooses to go right, they encounter a wobbly bridge and must decide whether to cross it or head back.
     - If they cross the bridge, they meet a stranger.
     - If they head back, they return to the main road and lose.
- If the user meets the stranger, they can choose to talk or not talk.
  - If they talk to the stranger, they win the game.
  - If they don't talk, the stranger gets offended and kills them.

PS: Invalid options will cause you to lose the game.
