# 1) QUIZ GAME: #

First, Welcome the user and ask whether he/she wants to play a game.

Then, ask users 4 Statistics abbreviation questions.

Tell at the end how many correct answers the user had, together with how much percentage of the answers were correct.

# 2) Random Number Guess Game #

Tell the user to guess a number from 0 to 10. 

If their guess is lower than 0 or higher than 10, tell them to guess again.

If their guess is higher or lower than the random number, let them know.

Also, tell the user how many attempts they guessed the number correctly.
